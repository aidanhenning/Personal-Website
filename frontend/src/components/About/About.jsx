        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-center text-black dark:text-white mb-2">
        Hi, I’m Aidan Henning - a Software Developer and recent graduate of
        Fullstack Academy with a background in real estate management.
      </p>
      <p className="text-center text-black dark:text-white mb-2">
        While managing multifamily properties, I discovered my interest in
        coding. What started as a personal curiosity quickly grew into a genuine
        passion for building projects and solving complex problems. As a result,
        I decided to make a career pivot and enroll in a software development
        bootcamp.
      </p>
      <p className="text-center text-black dark:text-white mb-8">
        Today, I enjoy applying my problem-solving skills, creativity, and
        attention to detail to build applications that create real value for
        people. I’m excited to grow as a fullstack developer, learn from
        experienced teams, and contribute to building meaningful web
        applications that improve people’s lives.
